# COVID-19 Dashboard: 2020-2021

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard built using the **COVID-19 dataset** sourced from [Our World in Data]([https://ourworldindata.org/](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)). The dataset spans the **start of 2020 to the end of 2021** and provides insights into global COVID-19 trends during this period. I learnt basic data exploration , data cleaning using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and Microsoft Excel and data visualization with Tableau through this project. 

## Visualizations

I made 4 different visualizations :
1) **Global Statistics of Covid** : Showing worldwise total cases, total deaths and death percentage.
2) **Total Deaths Per Continent** : Bar diagram displaying continent wise number of total deaths.
3) **Percentage Population Infected Per Country** : Drilled down to percentage of population infected per country.
4) **Percent Population Infected** : Displayed average population infected for some countries for each month from 2020 to 2021 .

Datasets used have been made public in the repository.
